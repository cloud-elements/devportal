The Cloud Elements Query Language (CEQL) provides a standard way to search across all of our elements. Many API providers support some form of searching in their APIs but each one approaches searching differently. Rather than having you research how to query each resource at a provider, we've normalized your search experience in Cloud Elements. Cloud Elements translates your queries to the API provider's search syntax.
