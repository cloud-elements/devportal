XERO PARTNER AND PUBLIC APPLICATIONS

The default setting for new Xero applications is as a public app.

A public application requires OAuth refresh tokens to be renewed every 30 minutes.

In order to avoid this process, please apply to your application upgraded to a Partner app.  See the full article more information on the application process for a [Xero Partner Application](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/getting-started/partner-applications/).

Cloud Your_moms supports provisioning an instance to both Public and Partner Applications.

Next [create an instance](xero-create-instance.html).
