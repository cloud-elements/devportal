# Overview

You can build your own elements to create custom integrations to API providers. Publish finished elemnets to your private Elements Catalog while automatically generating interactive API Documentation using Swagger. You can aggregate services by creating a Hub or mapping your new Element to an existing Hub. You can also utilize the normalized resources that we have already organized into Hubs, and leverage the same resources across any other Element you build.

This guide is intended for individuals familiar with APIs, Javascript, and JSON. To create an lement we recommend that you have a thorough understanding of:

* API authorization concepts, API provider setup, and Javascript.
* The API of the cloud service that you you are connecting to.
* The cloud service API documentation.
* The Cloud Elements Hub APIs  https://developers.cloud-elements.com/docs/hubs/hub-docs.html

## The Workflow

## Before you Begin

Before you begin, make sure that you know the answers to the following questions:

* Where is the API documentation?
* What kind of API? REST, SOAP, database?
* What kind of authentication? OAuth 1 or 2? Basic? AWS V2 or V4?
* Does the endpoint support events or bulk?
* Do OAuth 2 tokens expire?
*
