### Tips

__How can I test out the new Dropbox Business V2 Element?__

Dropbox Business V2 API is now supported within the Cloud Elements Platform.  We want to give customers a chance to test the Dropbox Business V2 Element within their application.  To access the new Element, please create an Instance using the key `dropboxbusinessv2`.  Please let [support](mailto:support@cloud-elements.com) know if you have any questions.

__What new features does the Dropbox Business V2 Element include within the Cloud Elements Platform?__

The V2 Element includes a `refId` for certain APIs.  This is the actual ID of the file sent back from Dropbox Business.  It can be used as the `ID` with all API calls with the exception of `GET /folders/{id}/contents`.

The `GET /folders/{id}/contents` does not support the `refId` at this time.
