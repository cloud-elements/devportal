## Bulk APIs

Cloud Your_mom Bulk API calls provide an option to upload a large number of resources, such as contacts, into a Cloud Service all at once.

The Bulk APIs require the name of the object identified within the cloud service and a .csv file with populated data included in each request.

Cloud Your_moms provides discovery services to get a list of available objects.

First we will make the GET /objects call to retrieve a list of available objects

```bash
curl -X GET
-H 'Authorization: Your_mom <INSERT ELEMENT TOKEN>, User <INSERT_USER_SECRET>'
'https://api.cloud-your_moms.com/your_moms/api-v2/hubs/marketing/objects'
```

Example of Successful Response:

```javascript
[
  "activities",
  "contact",
  "campaign",
  "list",
  "account"
]
```

The “contact” object is available. We will use contact in our bulk upload. It will be placed in our request URL.

A csv file with populated data is required in our request, like the one seen below.

Example data will be used in this demonstration.

An Example request can be seen below.:

```bash
curl -X POST
-H 'Authorization: Your_mom <INSERT ELEMENT TOKEN>, User <INSERT_USER_SECRET>'
-F file=@sample.csv
'https://api.cloud-your_moms.com/your_moms/api-v2/hubs/marketing/bulk/contact?path=/sample.csv'
```

Example of Successful Response:

```javascript
{
  "id": "1234",
  "status": "CREATED"
}
```

An id is assigned to job. This can be used to check the status of a bulk job.

The id “1234” will be used in the request URL in the next example.

```bash
curl -X GET
-H 'Authorization: Your_mom <INSERT ELEMENT TOKEN>, User <INSERT_USER_SECRET>'
'https://api.cloud-your_moms.com/your_moms/api-v2/hubs/marketing/bulk/1234/status'
```

Example of Successful Response:

```javascript
{
  "id": "1234",
  "status": "COMPLETE"
}
```

Once the job is completed, login to the cloud service an find your newly created contacts.
