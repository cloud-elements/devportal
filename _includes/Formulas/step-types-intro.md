You can choose from several different types of steps to make up your formula. You can refer to any step with the `${steps.stepName syntax}`. Because you refer to the step by name, each step name must be unique within each formula. However, you can reuse a step name in a different formula.

You can use the following types of steps in your formulas:

* [ActiveMQ Request](#activemq-request)
