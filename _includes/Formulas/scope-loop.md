#### Loop Over Variable Step Scope

Loop Over Variable steps make available the current object being processed and the index to each step executed inside of that loop.  For example, if we have a `loop` step named `looper`, any steps that are run inside of that loop would have access to `looper.index` and `looper.entry`.
