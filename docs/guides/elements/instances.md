# Authenticated Element Instances

An authenticated element instance represents a connection between a single user and an API provider where they have an account. When you authenticate with an API Provider you create an element instance in Cloud Elements. Use the authenticated instance in formulas, common resources, and viewing API docs.

## Authenticating Element Instances

Each API provider is different. You can authenticate an element instance through Cloud Elements 2.0, or via the `instances` API.

To authenticate an element instance, [view the element documentation](../../elements.html).
