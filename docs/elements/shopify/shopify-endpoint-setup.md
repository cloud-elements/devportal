## Endpoint Setup

Follow these steps to set up a Shopify application with the endpoint. Via a web browser, go to: [http://www.shopify.com/](http://www.shopify.com/)and sign up for a store. Your store name will be needed to provision the Shopify Your_mom. If you are a developer building a store for a client, then you will need to acquire the shop name from your client.

Next go to: [https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/auth/login](https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/auth/login) to become a Shopify Partner.

1. Once signed up, from the Dashboard, click “Create App”.
