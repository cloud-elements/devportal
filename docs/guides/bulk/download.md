# Bulk Download

Use bulk download to generate a csv or json file from a large number of records. Since the bulk download works asynchronously, you need to make two calls to download a file.

### 1. Create a Bulk Job
The `POST /bulk/query` creates a bulk job, which builds out a file in Cloud Elements. Use a CEQL query to specify the records included in the file. Since the job will take an unknown amount of time to complete, add a callback url to the bulk job. When the job completes it will make a callback to the url. 

The bulk query API call is composed of the following parts:

- Headers:
  - `Elements-Async-Callback-Url`: The webhook to be notified when a job completes.
- Query:
  - `q` : A CEQL query for records to be included in the bulk job, for example: `select * from contacts`.

### 2. Download the Bulk File
After the job generated from the `/bulk/query` call completes, use `GET /bulk/{id}/{objectName}` to download the file. The file can be downloaded as a csv or json file.

- Headers:
  - `Accept`: The format of the file to download, either `text/csv` or `application/json`.
- Path:
  - `{id}`: The bulk job id generated by `POST /bulk/query`.
  - `{objectName}`: The object name that was used to generate the bulk query.
