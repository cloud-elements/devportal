## Site Structure

Element Docs will be placed in their respective folder, e.g. Salesforce.
The Element Docs are structured in the following way:

```bash
|-- root
  |-- docs
    |-- elements
      |-- element folder (e.g. Salesforce)
        |-- element specific docs (e.g. endpoint set up, create instance)
```

Other Product docs like Element Builder, Mapper, Loader, Formulas are located at the docs level:

```bash
|-- root
  |-- docs
    |-- element Builder
      |-- element builder specific docs (e.g. how to guides, videos)
```
## Conventions

All documents are composed in markdown.  HTML can be used right in the markdown docs.
