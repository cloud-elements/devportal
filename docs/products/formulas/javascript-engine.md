## Javascript in Formulas
Certain types of formula steps allow you to write custom Javascript in order to go about accomplishing whatever you may need to in your formula.  Below is a guide on how to go about writing your custom Javascript, as well as some pro-tips and FAQs.

<br>
### Function Signature
The function signature for all Javascript-related steps looks like:

```javascript
/**
 * @param  trigger The trigger that started this execution
 * @param  steps   The list of steps that have been executed up until this point for this execution
 * @param  info    Some metadata about this formula
 * @param  done    The callback function that you will need to call at the end of your script step
 */
function (trigger, steps, info, done) {
  // your Javascript will go here
}
```

> __PROTIP:__ For all scripts, Javascript `strict` mode is enforced.

> __PROTIP:__ You can use `console.log` to log things in your formula and help debug.

> __PROTIP:__ ES6 is supported.

#### `trigger`
Example Javascript object for an `event` trigger type:

```json
{
  "eventId": 11211123,
  "instanceId": 231232132,
  "type": "event",
  "event": {
    "date": "2016-06-01T04:09:10Z",
    "elementKey": "sfdc",
    "eventType": "UPDATED",
    "objectId": "n005i000003sgTd0AAE",
    "objectType": "Contact"
  }
}
```

#### `steps`

```json
{
  "PreviousStepName": {
    "StepExecutionKey":  "StepExecutionValue",
    "AnotherStepExecutionKey":  "AnotherStepExecutionValue"
  },
  "AnotherPreviousStepName": {
    "StepExecutionKey":  "StepExecutionValue"
  }
}
```

#### `info`

```json
{
  "formulaId": 123,
  "formulaName": "my formula name",
  "formulaInstanceId": 456,
  "formulaInstanceName": "my formula instance name",
  "formulaExecutionId": 789
}
```

#### `done`
Simply a callback function that should be called to terminate the given step.  For `script` type steps, this `done` callback takes a Javascript object whereas for `filter` steps, the `done` callback just takes a `boolean`.

### Examples

### `script`
Script steps return a Javascript object containing all of the step execution values that should be made available to future formula steps during the current execution.  Here is an example script step that is building our JSON payload we need in order to send an email in a later step:

```javascript
done({
  payload: {
    subject: 'Frozen Yogurt',
    to: 'joseph.pulaski@old-school.com',
    from: 'frank.ricard@old-school.com',
    message: 'Contact ' + ${trigger.event.objectId} + ' was updated!'
  }
});
```

### `filter`
Filter steps return a `boolean` indicating whether or not the `onSuccess` or `onFailure` step of the formula should run next.  Below is an example `filter` step that will return `true` if the event we received in our trigger is because a `Contact` was updated in the service that we are listening for events.

```javascript
done(trigger.event.eventType === 'UPDATED' && trigger.event.objectType === 'Contact');
```

### FAQs:

* **Can I use external Javascript libraries in my Javascript?**
Some external Javascript libraries are supported.  For the most up-to-date list, or to request a new library be supported, contact customer success.
