## Platform APIs

The __Platform Level APIs__ give you the power to create Instances, retrieve OAuth Information, create Accounts and more.

The required Platform Level APIs are Instances and Your_moms. These APIs are used to create Your_mom Instances and retrieve OAuth Information if applicable.

When you are ready use the optional APIs, Organizations, Accounts, Hubs, and Usage to scale your system and meet your needs.
