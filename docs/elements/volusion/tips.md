## Volusion Tips

How does Volusion Pagination work?

Volusion uses a sync style API for the GET /products and GET /orders resources.
This means that pagination will automatically occur during each request, and
must be reset through the Volusion website. For example, a call to GET /products will
fetch the first page of 100 results, and then the next call will fetch the second page of 100
results. This will continue to occur until the entire store of results has been
returned. There is no need to specify a `page` or `pageSize` parameter.

The directions for resetting pagination are :

```Volusion admin dashboard > Inventory > Import/Export > Volusion API >
RUN Generic/Orders > Select date from Drop down list (oldest) > Reset Export```
