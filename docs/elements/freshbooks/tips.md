## Tips

FreshBooks response payloads are by default formatted in XML.  Cloud Elements transforms the response payloads from XML to JSON in each of the API calls.

Due to this transformation, the ‘@’ and ‘$’ symbols will be seen in the JSON response payloads.  Fields prefixed with the ‘@’ are interpreted as attributes and the ‘$’ field represents text content.  Let’s take a look at an example.

Here is some example JSON with the ‘@’ and ‘$’ representing fields in the phone-number portion of the object.

```json
{
  "customer" : {
    "first-name" : "Jane",
    "last-name" : "Doe",
    "address" : {
      "street" : "123 A Street"
    },
    "phone-number" : [ {
      "@type" : "work",
      "$" : "555-1111"
    }, {
      "@type" : "cell",
      "$" : "555-2222"
    } ]
  }
}
```

The transformed XML would look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<customer>
    <first-name>Jane</first-name>
    <last-name>Doe</last-name>
    <address>
        <street>123 A Street</street>
    </address>
    <phone-number type="work">555-1111</phone-number>
    <phone-number type="cell">555-2222</phone-number>
</customer>
```
