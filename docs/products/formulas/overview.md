### Formula User Guides

Cloud Elements supports customizable workflows, called __formulas__ to keep your systems in sync.
Cloud Elements currently supports formula creation via API and via the Formula Builder UI within the API Manager Console.

The formula developer docs are broken down into four guides:

* [Formula Creation via API](formulas-via-api.html)
* [Example Formula Use Cases](formula-use-cases.html)
* [Formula Debugging Tips](formula-debugging.html)

If working with APIs is your preferred method, view the [Formula Creation via API](formulas-via-api.html) Guide.

View our [Formulas Use Cases Guide](formula-use-cases.html) for example use cases such as, when a contact is created in a CRM service, the same contact is created in the Marketing service. See screenshots and example API calls.

View our [Formulas Debugging Tips](formula-debugging.html) for suggestions on debugging your formula. See screenshots and example API calls.
