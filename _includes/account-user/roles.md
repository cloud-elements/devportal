User roles define the information that a specific user assigned to the role can view and what they can do in Cloud Elements. Each role includes a list of privileges that you can add or remove depending on how you want to manage roles in your organization.

Cloud Elements supports the following roles:

* Organization Administrator &mdash; Manage all aspects of security; create elements, formula templates, and common resources for the organization;  and can access all logs in Activity.
* Account Administrator &mdash; Performs the same function of the Organization Administrator, but only on the account where they are the administrator. Account Administrator cannot create or manage accounts or set security rules.
* Default User &mdash; A non-administrator role for users in non-default accounts.
* Organization User &mdash; non-administrator users in the default company account. Users with the Organization User have no different privileges than other default users.
