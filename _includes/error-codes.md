## Error Codes

Errors are never fun. To save you time we took a list of error codes from our service providers and normalized them into one list. If an error message is returned that includes a specific detail about the method call, we will send our normalized error code along with any additional data that comes from the provider in the body of the message. Below is a sample message from a service provider that would be included with our normalized error code.

```javascript
{
   "message": "Failed to upload file. File with the same name already exists. Change the name of the file you're uploading or set the overwrite query parameter to true.",
   "requestId": "53dbca9430045c016b46566c",
   "providerMessage": "Item with the same name already exists"
}
```
A complete list of our normalized error codes can be found below.
