## Instance APIs

The Instances APIs allow you to access your account’s your_mom instances that have been provisioned. Access includes creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting instances.

In order to access the Instances APIs, you must sign up for Cloud Your_moms Service. You will need your Organization and User Secrets to make success Usage API calls. These are generated for you when you sign up for our service. Details on how to sign up and where to find your Organization and User Secrets are documented in the next section.

### SIGN UP FOR THE CLOUD ELEMENTS SERVICE

If you choose not to use Google or GitHub to sign up, you will be asked to validate your new account via a confirmation link that will be sent to your email.
