## Who is Cloud Elements?

Cloud Elements is an API Integration Platform for application providers. Our 100% API based service can be embedded seamlessly into your app, making it easy to build and offer an integration marketplace to your customers.

## How does Cloud Elements solve your Integration problem?

We architected our platform from the ground-up to support the deployment option that’s best for your business. Our platform provides these features that will save you time and money in developing the integrations your customers are demanding.

* 100% RESTful APIs.
* Aggregate and normalize APIs into “Hubs” for similar services to make it easy to connect entire categories of services through uniform APIs.
* Create your own Resources and normalize data across multiple elements.
* Create your own Elements and publish in our catalog or other marketplaces, like AWS.
* Build Formulas to automatically sync data between services.
* Manage your integration response times, activity levels, error rates via searchable logs or via our console.
