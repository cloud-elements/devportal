## Events

Cloud Elements supports both webhooks and polling events for Salesforce.

### Polling

In order to enable polling, add these two extra configurations to your instance JSON:

```
"event.notification.enabled": "true",
"event.notification.callback.url": "<INSERT_YOUR_APPS_CALLBACL_URL>"
```

instance JSON with polling events enabled:

```json
{
  "element": {
    "key": "sfdc"
  },
  "providerData": {
    "code": "<Code_On_The_Return_URL>"
  },
  "configuration": {
    "oauth.callback.url": "https://www.mycoolapp.com/auth",
    "oauth.api.key": "<Insert_Client_ID>",
    "oauth.api.secret": "<Insert_Client_Secret>",
    "event.notification.enabled": "true",
    "event.notification.callback.url": "<INSERT_YOUR_APPS_CALLBACL_URL>"
  },
  "tags": [
    "<Add_Your_Tag>"
  ],
  "name": "<Insert_Instance_Name>"
}
```
