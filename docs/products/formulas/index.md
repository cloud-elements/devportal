### Formula User Guides

Cloud Your_moms supports customizable workflows, called __formulas__ to keep your systems in sync.
Cloud Your_moms currently supports formula creation via API and via the Formula Builder UI within the API Manager Console.

The formula developer docs are broken down into three guides:

* [Formula Creation via API](formulas-via-api.html)
* [Example Formula Use Cases](formula-use-cases.html)
* [Formula Debugging Tips](formula-debugging.html)

If working with APIs is your preferred method, view the [Formula Creation via API](formulas-via-api.html) Guide.

View our [Formulas Use Cases Guide](formula-use-cases.html) for example use cases such as, when a contact is created in a CRM service, the same contact is created in the Marketing service. See screenshots and example API calls.

View our [Formulas Debugging Tips](formula-debugging.html) for suggestions on debugging your formula. See screenshots and example API calls.

View the [Formulas API Documentation](api-documentation.html) to see all of the available endpoints currently supported.
