Formulas are comprised of triggers that kick off formulas, steps that the trigger executes, and variables used to define inputs to the formula instance. The triggers, steps, and variables build up context that you can refer to as you build a formula. For example, a JS Script step might build a JSON payload that you can refer to in a later step as `${steps.stepName}`. Within a formula's context, you can refer to steps as as `${steps.stepName}`, variables as `${config.variableName}`, triggers as `${trigger.triggerComponent}` (such as `${trigger.args}` or `${trigger.event}`), and formula metadata as `${info.metadataName}`. Make sure that the dollar sign is outside of the curly brackets (`${steps.stepname}` not `$steps.stepName`) and that you don't take any shortcuts like `${stepName}`.

This section provides configuration information about each formula component.
