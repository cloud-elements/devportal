# Events

Cloud Elements supports events via polling or webhooks depending on the API provider. If you would like to see more information on our Events framework, please see the [Event Management Guide](/docs/platform/event-management/index.html).

## Supported Events and Resources

Cloud Elements supports polling events for {{page.heading}}. After receiving an event, Cloud Elements standardizes the payload and sends an event to the configured callback URL of your authenticated element instance.

Events for {{page.heading}} utilizes [SAP IDocs functionality](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_di46c2/4.6C2/en-US/72/c18ee5546a11d182cc0000e829fbfe/frameset.htm). To configure events, you must install a connector provided by Cloud Elements. Contact us for details.
