# API Provider Setup

To authenticate an {{page.heading}} element instance you must use your {{page.apiProvider}} **{{page.username}}** and **{{page.password}}**. You also must include the URL or IP address of your {{page.apiProvider}} account, for example `https://myserver.s4hana.ondemand.com`, as the **Host Name**. Lastly, use the Instance Number and System ID from the System Entry Properties (see below). Contact your system administrator to get the information.
