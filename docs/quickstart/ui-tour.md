## Elements Catalog

The Elements Catalog provides a list of the API providers available in Cloud Elements.  If you donâ€™t see an element that you need, you can build one yourself. If you're ready to learn all about elements, take a look at [Manage Elements](../guides/elements/index.html) in the Guides on the left.

![Elements Catalog](img/elements.png)

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/1.png" alt="1" class="inlineImage"> Search for an element by name.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/2.png" alt="2" class="inlineImage"> Build a custom element.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/3.png" alt="3" class="inlineImage"> Interact with elements through its element card. Authenticate an instance with the API provider, see the API docs, export the element, or add your own resources to an element.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/4.png" alt="4" class="inlineImage"> See how many authenticated element instances that you connected to the API provider.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/5.png" alt="4" class="inlineImage"> Labels tell you more about the element: the hub that it is in, if it's beta, and if it is a custom element (private).

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/6.png" alt="5" class="inlineImage"> Get help about what you see on the page.

## Common Resources and Transformations

The Common Resources > Transformations page shows your common resource on the left, and how you mapped fields from an element resource (the API provider) on the right. When you're ready to define your own common resource and map it to one of your API providers, go to [Defining Common Resources & Transformations](../guides/common-resources/index.html) in the Guides on the left.

![Common Resources](img/common-resources.png)

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/1.png" alt="1" class="inlineImage"> Define a new common resource.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/2.png" alt="2" class="inlineImage"> Access the common resources that you already defined.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/3.png" alt="3" class="inlineImage"> Define a common resource based on an existing common resource, a Cloud Elements template, or a resource at the API provider.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/4.png" alt="4" class="inlineImage"> On the left side, define the fields in the common resource.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/5.png" alt="4" class="inlineImage"> On the right side, map fields in the API provider's resource to the fields you defined in the common resource.


## Formulas

The Formulas page shows all of your formula templates and enables you to create a new template or set up a formula instance. See [Building Formulas](../guides/common-resources/index.html) in the Guides on the left for detailed instructions.

![Formulas Page](img/formulas.png)

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/1.png" alt="1" class="inlineImage"> Build a formula template.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/2.png" alt="2" class="inlineImage"> Use the formula card to open the template and view it or make changes, export the template as a JSON file, or create an individual instance of the formula.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/3.png" alt="3" class="inlineImage"> See how many instances you have of each formula.


## Activity

The Activity page is the central location to monitor your logs and metrics.

![Activity Page](img/activity.png)

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/1.png" alt="1" class="inlineImage"> Search for a specific log entry or metric.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/2.png" alt="2" class="inlineImage"> Filter the results by company, date, and time.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/3.png" alt="3" class="inlineImage"> Select what activity you'd like to monitor.


## API Docs

Everything you can do in Cloud Element, you can accomplish with a uniform API. You can view each of our endpoints and make requests with the interactive documentation.

![Cloud Elements API Docs](img/apis.png)

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/1.png" alt="1" class="inlineImage"> Select any of our platform APIs to interact with Cloud Elements and manage accounts, work with our elements, formulas, and hubs, or even create a custom element.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/2.png" alt="2" class="inlineImage"> See how we normalize resources in each of our hubs. Select an authenticated instance within the hub to try out the requests.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/3.png" alt="3" class="inlineImage"> View our interactive API docs.

<img src="/assets/img/callouts/4.png" alt="4" class="inlineImage"> What the button says: select a resource and try it out. In this case, you'll authenticate an element instance.
