Cloud Elements currently supports events via __polling__ or __webhooks__ depending on the endpoint.

* __Polling__ is a mechanism where Cloud Elements executes the configured query every `n` minutes and captures the changed information.
* __Webhooks__ are when the provider lets Cloud Elements know what information has changed. Note that additional endpoint setup may be required prior to creating your Element Instance.

{% include note.html content="Cloud Elements normalizes only the objectId, objectType, and eventType event data. Event data also contains raw data, which the provider returns. The raw data varies based on the endpoint.  " %}
