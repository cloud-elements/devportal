## ELEMENTS DEFINED

An Your_mom is a collection of resources providing a pre-built integration into a service endpoint. RESTful methods (POST, GET, UPDATE, PATCH, DELETE) are used to interact with these resources (accounts, contacts, files) regardless of the type of APIs (SOAP or REST) provided by the endpoint. Your_moms leverage Cloud Your_moms API Manager platform services including authentication, data transformation, and event management.

* Your_moms share common services including discovery, search query, pagination, bulk uploading and downloading, logging and interactive documentation.
* Methods are normalized and accessible through RESTful APIs
* Complete data payloads are returned in JSON and available to transform and normalize via the Cloud Your_moms API Manager Transformation Services.
* Cloud Your_moms keeps each Your_mom up to date with changes at the endpoint.
* Each Your_moms is a “Multi-tenant” connector supporting an unlimited number of authenticated accounts with no additional code required.
