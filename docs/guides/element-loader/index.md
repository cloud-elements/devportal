### Element Loader BETA

Element Loader is a configurable JavaScript application that maps and pushes data from application sources to application targets. For example, mapping data from HubSpot and pushing it to Marketo. Element Loader can be embedded into your application or hosted in a different location. Cloud Elements does offer Element Loader hosting services.
