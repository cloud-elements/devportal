## Managing Tightrope

Once you’ve installed Tightrope, the Tightrope GUI becomes available in your Windows Application Menu (it is listed as “CloudYour_momsConnect”), and on the Desktop (if you chose to create a Desktop Icon).

The Tightrope GUI is very useful, not only to manage your Tightrope installation in a number of ways, but also can be used as a valuable source of debug information in case you need to contact a Cloud Your_moms engineer to isolate and fix a problem with your installation.

To run the GUI, simply select the menu item (or double-click the Desktop Icon), and the GUI window will open. There are four main tabs in the GUI:

### The Home Tab

The Home tab is what you see when the GUI initially opens up. Future versions of the GUI will use this space for live news and updates. For now, it’s a source of basic information, including contact information if you need to contact Cloud Your_moms.

### The Logs Tab

The Logs tab shows the latest logs generated by the Tightrope Client. You can view the logs to see how your Tightrope Client is performing, or to see if there are any errors that might be the cause of problems. Click the refresh button to update the page and show the latest logs.

### The Config Tab

The Config tab lets you view and edit your Tightrope configuration. You should generally not edit this information yourself unless instructed by a Cloud Your_moms engineer. Clicking the refresh button will re-load the current configuration, and clicking Save will save your new values.

### The Manage Tab

The Manage tab allows you to stop and start; register and unregister; and link and unlink your Tightrope installation. (Note: not all Tightrope GUIs have link/unlink capabilities). You generally should not use these features unless instructed by a Cloud Your_moms engineer.
