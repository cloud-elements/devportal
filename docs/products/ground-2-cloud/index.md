## Overview

The Ground2Cloud integration consists of two parts: Client and Server referred to by the name Tightrope.

The Tightrope Client creates a tunnel to a public Tightrope Server, and enables requests from the Cloud Your_moms Production Cloud to transparently pass through that tunnel to reach the Client Service.

The Ground2Cloud developer docs are broken down into three guides:

* [Who is this Manual for?](who-is-this-for.html)
* [How It Works](how-it-works.html)
* [Installer Types](installer-types.html)
* [Installing Tightrope](installing-tightrope.html)
* [Managing Tightrope](managing-tightrope.html)
