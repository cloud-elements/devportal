# Endpoint Setup

To create a Salesforce Element Instance you must have the Enterprise edition or Professional edition with API support. Also, to set up a new application in Salesforce, you must have Administrator privileges. Contact your system administrator if you do not have those privileges.

To set up the endpoint:

1. Via a web browser, log in to your Salesforce account:
  * Sandbox: [https://test.salesforce.com/](https://test.salesforce.com/)
  * Production: [https://login.salesforce.com/](https://login.salesforce.com/)
1. If not already on the Setup page, [navigate to it](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=basics_nav_setup.htm&type=0).
2. In the menu on the left, click __Apps__, and then click __App Manager__.
