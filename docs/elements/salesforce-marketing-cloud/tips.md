## Tips

The Tips section includes more information about the element including FAQs, endpoint limitations, and general tips.

### APIs

Salesforce Marketing Cloud does not support the `GET Contacts` API to get the list of Contacts.  This is common functionality for other elements in the Marketing hub, but is not available today.

### General
* The Salesforce Marketing Cloud is based on what was previously the Exact Target application.
* Note that there is currently a bug in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud application such that created and modified times coming back that are returned from Salesforce are not valid.  Salesforce has acknowledged this issue but there is not currently a timeframe that they have committed to fix this.   Until they do, Events are not possible in this Element.
