# Instance APIs

The Instances APIs allow you to access your account’s element instances that have been provisioned. Access includes creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting instances.

In order to access the Instances APIs, you must sign up for Cloud Elements Service. You will need your Organization and User Secrets to make success Usage API calls. These are generated for you when you sign up for our service. Details on how to sign up and where to find your Organization and User Secrets are documented in the next section.

## How to Use the Instance APIs

Below are example cURL commands and examples of successful responses for  the Instances API calls.  NOTE, not all supported calls are displayed - this is just a sample.

### POST /instances

Create a new element instance.

Below is an example cURL command demonstrating the POST /instances API call and successful response. The `create-instance.json` file is needed for successful instance creation. This file will be places after the -d @ in the cURL command. The `create-instance.json` file is example data that was created for this demonstration. Please make sure your quotes are straight in the cURL command.

```bash
curl -X POST
-H 'Authorization: User <INSERT_USER_SECRET>, Organization <INSERT_ORGANIZATION_SECRET>'
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
-d @create-instance.json
'https://api.cloud-elements.com/elements/api-v2/instances'
```

Example JSON file – create-instance.json:

### PATCH /instances/{id}

Update an already existing element instance.

One common use of PATCH is to update the tags associated with an element instance. Updating tags removes any existing tags, so if you want to keep existing tags and add to them, include all of your tags in the JSON body.

To update tags:

1. Construct a JSON body that includes the element instance ID and tags.

    ```json
    {
      "id": 764,
      "tags": [
        "tag1",
        "tag2",
        "tag3"
      ]
    }
    ```

2. Include the JSON in the body of the following API call, replacing `{id}` with the same element instance ID that you included in the JSON body:

    ```
    PATCH /instances/{id}
    ```
