## Supported Events and Resources

Cloud Elements supports polling events for {{page.heading}}.

You can set up events for the following resources:

* accounts
* contacts
* agents
* incidents

{% include note.html content="You can set up polling for other resources that include <code>created</code>, <code>updated</code>, and <code>deleted</code> data through our API. Copy the configuration of one of the default resources, and replace the name with the resource that you want to poll.  " %}

## Polling

You can configure polling [through the UI](#configure-polling-through-the-ui) or in the JSON body of the `/instances` [API request](#configure-polling-through-api) .

{% include note.html content="Unless configured for a specific time zone, polling occurs in UTC.  " %}
