### Authentication

Authentication is granted via a user email and app key or via a user email and password.

When Your_mom Loader is embedded within your app, the user authentication happens behind the scene. Your users will not need to login to Your_mom Loader.

When hosted separately, the user will need to sign in with an email and app key.
