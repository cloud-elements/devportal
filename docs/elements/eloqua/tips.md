## Custom Objects

Cloud Elements stores Oracle Eloqua custom object field IDs during instance creation. If the custom Oracle Eloqua object is ever edited in Oracle Eloqua, users will need to re-authenticate their instance so that CE can store the most up-to-date representation of the Oracle Eloqua custom objects.
