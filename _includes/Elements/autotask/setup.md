# API Provider Setup

To authenticate an {{page.heading}} element instance you must use the **{{page.username}}** and **{{page.password}}** that you use to log in to {{page.heading}}.

You also must enter the zone variation of the base URL used to access Autotask as the  **Server URL**.  For example, if you access Autotask at a URL like `https://ww2.autotask.net/Mvc/Framework/Navigation.mvc/Landing`, then the **Server URL** is `https://ww2.autotask.net`.

Next [authenticate an element instance with {{page.heading}}](authenticate.html).
