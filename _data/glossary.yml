common_resource: "An API resource that defines normalized fields for frequently used resources that you can use in place of specific elements to facilitate one-to-many integrations. You map fields from element resources to the common resource fields to create transformations."

normalize: "Relates to transforming information from vendors to a common language within Cloud Elements."

field: "Data within a resource."

map: "The process of associating objects within a vendor's resource to objects in a common resource so the vendor objects can be transformed."

transformation: "The conversion of objects in the vendor's resource to objects in a common resource."

element-instance: "The specific authenticated instance of an element."

element-instance-resource: "The resources available to the element instance through its API."

element: "An enhanced connector that provides a unified developer experience into a specic cloud application endpoint (e.g., Salesforce, Quickbooks, or Marketo)."

resource: "Specific endpoints within an API that contain objects accessible via the API. "

one-to-many: "Enables developers to write to one API to integrate multiple elements."

formula-template: "A reusable workflow that is independent of the Element and includes the triggers, steps, and variables for a formula instance to execute the workflow. "

formula-instance: "A specific instance of a formula template configured with explicit variables and associated with specific element instances."

formula-trigger: "An action that occurs and kicks off a formula. Triggers can be events set up on an element instance, an API call to an element instance, a scheduled occurrence, or manually triggered."

formula-step: "An individual step within a formula workflow that can include branches to subsequent success and failure steps."

formula-variable: "Variables that represent either element instances or specific values that must be supplied for each formula instance."

polling: "An event option where Cloud Elements checks for changes to a resource in a configurable duration and captures the changed information"

webhooks: "An event option where the service provider notifies Cloud Elements that changes to a resouce occurred. Typically you must configure webhooks settings at the service provider prior to implementing webhooks for your authenticated element instance."

organization: "The top level of the accounts and users hierarchy that represents the Cloud Elements customer."

account: "The second level of the accounts and users hierarchy that represents your customers."

user: "The third level of the accounts and users hierarchy that represents individual instances of elements and transformations."

organization-administrator: "The user  that can manage accounts and is associated with the initial sign up with Cloud Elements."
