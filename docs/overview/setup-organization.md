## Setting Up Your Organization

### What to do First

__Create an account__ in the [Cloud Elements Developer Console](https://console.cloud-elements.com/elements/jsp/signup.jsp)
Once you get logged into the Console, locate the `ADMINISTRATION` menu on the left hand side.

The Administration menu allows you to create accounts and user logins for your customers.

By clicking on the Accounts menu, you will get a list of each account that has been set up.  A single account would represent one of your customers.  Each account could then have multiple users, each belonging to that organization.

To add additional admin users, click the master account (usually the first account in the list).  From there, you can click the “`Add User`” button to add any additional administrators you may need.

To add a new customer account, click the “`Add Account`” button and fill in the details for that account.  The External ID is a configurable number, so you can use any numbering scheme you’d like.

After creating a new customer account, you can add users to it.

When creating users, the email and password will be the Cloud Elements login that user will use in order to set up their Element and/or Formula Instances.
