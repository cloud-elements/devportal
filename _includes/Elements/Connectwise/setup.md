# API Provider Setup

To authenticate a {{page.heading}} element instance you need have an account with ConnectWise and know your Server URL including the WSDL path. The WSDL path appears in the URL that ConnectWise redirects you to after you log in. For example, in the following URL the beginning of the WSDL path appears after the ConnectWise URL:

        https://my.connectwise.com/v2017_2/ConnectWise.aspx?locale=en_US&session=...

The resulting WSDL path is `/v2017_2/apis/2.0/`.


Next [authenticate an element instance with {{page.heading}}](authenticate.html).
