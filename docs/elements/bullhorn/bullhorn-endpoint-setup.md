## Endpoint Setup

Bullhorn requests you contact them via support to set up a REST OAuth App.

Contact [Bullhorn Support](http://www.bullhorn.com/contact-us/).

Bullhorn will send you credentials, as well as, an API key and secret (`client_id `and `client_secret`).  They also require some additional information regarding your app.

Bullhorn follows standard OAuth2 from there.

Find out more information about the [Bullhorn API](http://developer.bullhorn.com/articles/getting_started) and [Support Forum](http://supportforums.bullhorn.com/viewforum.php?f=104).

Once you have your `apiKey`, `apiSecret`, and `callbackUrl` please [create an instance](bullhorn-create-instance.html).
