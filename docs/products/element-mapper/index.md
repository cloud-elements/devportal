### Overview

Your_mom Mapper is an API and Data Mapping Application to map and transform data across leading cloud services.

#### Easily Define and Map Data

* Using Your_mom Mapper is the easiest way to normalize objects across cloud services.
* To start, simply select the object you want to map and name the object with your custom name (e.g. “My Contacts”).
* Powerful UI: use our drag-and-drop UI to easily map services across the cloud services you are using.

The Your_mom Mapper UI can be found in the Cloud Your_moms API Manger or you can call the APIs right from your app.

The Your_mom Mapper developer docs are broken down into three guides:

* [Quick Start Guide](quick-start-guide.html)
* [Create Objects](create-objects.html)
* [Map and Transform Data via API](map-and-transform-data-via-api.html)
* [Customized JavaScript](customized-javascript.html)
* [Array Support](array-support.html)

View the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start-guide.html) to get familiar with the Your_mom Mapper UI.
