# Overview

Elements are enhanced connectors that provide a unified developer experience into a specific cloud application endpoint (e.g., Salesforce, Quickbooks, or Marketo). The Elements Catalog includes a list of all publicly available elements as well as any custom elements that you create. Use these elements to [create authenticated connections](instances.html) &mdash; called element instances &mdash; to your API providers.

## Elements Catalog

The Elements Catalog shows a list of element cards that represent all of the elements available to you. Elements with your existing authenticated <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.element-instance}}">element instances</a> appear at the top. Each card shows the name and id of the element, the  number of authenticated element instances, and the  <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.hub}}">hub</a> associated with the element.

To work with an element, hover over the element card.  You can [authenticate an element instance](instances.html), [see the API docs(#view-element-api-docs)] associated with the element, see how the elements is configured, and [add your own resources](resources.html) to the element.

You can also [add your own custom elements](custom-elements.html) to the the catalog. These include a **private** label because they are available only to users in your organization.

## View Element API Docs

You can view the generic API docs for a specific element, but if you use an authenticated element instance, you can interact with the docs as well.

To view

1. Hover and click
