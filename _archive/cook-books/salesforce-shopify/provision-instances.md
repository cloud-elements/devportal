# Provision Salesforce and Hubspot Instances

In order to move data between Salesforce and Hubspot accounts, we will need to create an instance of each.

It's helpful to think of **Elements** and **Instances** like Object-Oriented Classes. An Element is similar to a class or template. An Instance is an instantiation of the Element or template.

Checkout out [definitions section](https://developers.cloud-elements.com/docs/overview/definitions.html) to better understand the difference between an element and an element instance.

## Add a Hubspot Instance

Under the elements catalog, find the **Hubspot CRM** element and add an instance of it.

There are a couple configuration properties that are important for this example. The `Vendor Event type` should be set to polling and `Enabled/Disable Event Notifications` should be set to true. This tells Cloud Elements to check Hubspot for changes and creates a notification for when there is a change.

It's also important to set the `Event poller refresh interval` and `Event Poller URLs`. These properties tell the instance how often to check for changes, and what resources to check.  
The `Event poller refresh interval` is set in minutes, in this case, the interval is set to 2 minutes. `Event Poller URLs` is pointing to `contacts`, which will check Hubspot's contact resources for changes.

We can ignore the other fields in the configuration.

## Add a Salesforce Instance

Follow the same steps as above to provision a Salesforce instance.

In the case of Salesforce `Objects to Monitor for Changes` should be set to `Contact`. Note that this is a different field from Hubspot. When creating instances of different Elements, the configuration settings will differ slightly. 

The Salesforce configuration should like this:

Under the **My Instances** tab of **Elements**, there should be an instance of Salesforce and an Instance of Hubspot.

**Reminder:** Provisioning instances of Salesforce and Hubspot can also be accomplished via the Cloud Elements API. Check of the element guides for more details:

- [Hubspot Element Guide](https://developers.cloud-elements.com/docs/elements/hubspot-crm/hubspot-crm-create-instance.html)
