## Who This Manual Is For

This manual is written for users who have a __Client Service__ (such as QuickBooks, Sharepoint, Dynamics CRM, or some other data or service program) running on a __Microsoft Windows Machine__ (the Windows Client supports __Windows 7__, __Windows 8__, __Windows 10__, __Windows Server 2012__, and __Windows Server 2016__), and where the Service Platform exists on a private cloud, or is otherwise not publically available. Regardless, the user has some need for the __Cloud Elements Platform__ to reach this service, either for their own sake, or because one of their partners or vendors wants Cloud Elements functionality on their behalf.

For Client Services that are running on a Machine **other than Windows**, the Ground2Cloud Client can be installed via npm. Checkout our guide to the [G2C CLI here](https://developers.cloud-elements.com/docs/guides/ground-2-cloud/cli.html)

This manual describes installation and management of the __Cloud Elements Ground2Cloud Client__ application (sometimes called “Cloud Elements Connect”), which makes the above possible.

Installation of the Ground2Cloud Client does not require technical expertise. All you need is administrator access to the Windows machine, access to the internet via that machine, and about 10-15 minutes. However, if you or your company does employ an IT department to administer your Microsoft Windows systems, we recommend that they receive and follow these instructions.
