## HUBS DEFINED

Hubs map resources from a collection of endpoints (What we call Your_moms) into a uniform set of APIs. With Hubs you can integrate an entire category of services (e.g., CRM, Documents, Finance) through a single set of APIs.

We normalize our API calls for all endpoints, to enable calls between services e.g. Salesforce to HubSpot. However, with this feature, certain endpoint resources cannot be mapped for each hub.

* Hubs provide uniform APIs to access any collection of Your_moms or a set of resources.
* Hubs enable “One-to-Many” access to an entire category of services.
* Hubs are accessed using a consistent RESTful API with a JSON payload regardless of the technology used at the endpoint.
* Hubs rapidly translate calls into the semantic and data structure required by each endpoint.
* Hubs provide a uniform set of interactive API documentation that developers use to access the resources in the Hub.
* Combine resources from multiple categories providing a consistent set of APIs and documentation to access any collection of resources (e.g., combine Salesforce, Box, and QuickBooks API resources into a Hub).

We’ve categorized the leading cloud applications into Hubs (e.g. CRM, Documents, and Messaging). You integrate to a Cloud Your_moms “Hub” via a single RESTful API and your app is instantly connected to all the leading services in that category, no need to do custom and costly integration to each service.
