## Endpoint Setup

Microsoft Dynamics Great Plains 2013 has some initial setup that must be configured prior to creating an Element Instance.

Follow these steps to set up a Dynamics Great Plains application with the endpoint. Via a web browser, login to your Dynamics Great Plains account.

* Make sure the Legacy Endpoint is enabled
