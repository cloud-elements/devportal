A <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.common_resource}}">common resource</a> is a resource with <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.normalize}}">normalized</a> fields that you can use in place of specific elements to facilitate <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.one-to-many}}">one-to-many</a> integrations.

You can create a common resource based on an existing resource (template, element resource, or existing common resource) or as an entirely new resource. This guide includes instructions for both methods.
