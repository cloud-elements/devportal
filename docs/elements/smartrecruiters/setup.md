# API Provider Setup

To authenticate a {{page.heading}} element instance you must use the **{{page.username}}** assigned to a specific user. SmartRecruiters recommends that you use a dedicated Admin user and API Key for each integration.

You can view the  **{{page.username}}** only immediately after you create it. If you need to generate a new API Key, see the instructions in the SmartRecruiters app on the [API/Integrations](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/settings/configuration/api-integrations) page.

Next [authenticate an element instance with {{page.apiProvider}}](authenticate.html).
