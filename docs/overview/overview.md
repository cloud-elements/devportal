## Who is Cloud Elements?

Cloud Elements is the leading API integration platform for app providers and the digital enterprise. Our 100% API based service can be embedded seamlessly into your app, making it easy to build and offer an integration marketplace to your customers.

## How Does Cloud Elements Solve Your Integration Problem?

We architected Cloud Elements from the ground-up to support the deployment option that’s best for your business. We provide these features that will save you time and money in developing the integrations your customers are demanding:

* 100% RESTful APIs.
* Aggregate and normalize APIs into “Hubs” for similar services to make it easy to connect entire categories of services through uniform APIs.
* Create your own resources and normalize data across multiple elements.
* Create your own elements and publish in our catalog or other marketplaces, like AWS.
* Build formulas to automatically sync data between services.
* Manage your integration response times, activity levels, and error rates via searchable logs.
