# Overview

{% include callout.html content="The content of this guide is intended for users of Cloud Elements 2.0. Although much of the functionality is shared between versions, users of earlier version of Cloud Elements should also reference <a href=../../guides/formulas/index.html>Formulas</a>." type="warning" %}

In Cloud Elements you can build **formula templates**&mdash;reusable workflow templates that are independent of API providers. Formula templates include triggers, such as events, scheduled timers, or API requests, that kick off a series of steps. These steps can accomplish a large variety of different use cases across different services.  For example, they can keep systems in sync, migrate data between systems, or automate business workflows.
