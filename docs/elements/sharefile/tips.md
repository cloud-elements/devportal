## Tips

What's the difference between the `/root` and `/top` folders?

Some folders have shortcuts, which serve as folder names as well as IDs.  The `/top` folder is the `root` level folder.  This should be used in the path similarly to how a root level folder `/` would be used.  The other three, `favorites`, `home`, and `allshared` will be shortcuts to your `favorites`, `home`, and `shared` __root level folders__.
